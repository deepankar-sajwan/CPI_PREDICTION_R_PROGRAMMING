This project research attempted to answer the following question, “What is the best way to predict the consumer price index for indian market?” The overall objective was to forecast the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to assess the performance of various forecasting techniques against data collected from 2013 Jan to 2021 Mar.

Specifically, the project aimed to determine the top performing forecasting technique of the four assessed :

ARIMA Model
Holt And Winter Model
ETS Model
Neural Networks Model
The data has been collected for India for the year 2013 to 2021.

The consumer price index data has been collected for the following commodities.

Cereals and products
Meat and fish
Egg
Milk and products
Oils and fats
